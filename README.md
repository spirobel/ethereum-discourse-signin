# **Ethereum Discourse Sign-in** Plugin

Spruce id created a plugin that is very similar to what I had in mind: https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth

**So I focused my efforts to ideas that I wanted to work on later:**


a lot of the current ethereum tools and communites are built around discord. So many people asked me for a way to sync discord roles to discourse groups. This way you can integrate many of your old tools from discord with your discourse forum. No need to start from square one. 

The permissions someone has by getting a certain discord role, automatically carry over to a discourse group.


You can find the repository here:

And watch a short video on how to use it here:

What I am working on now: 

I am now working on the web3 building blocks plugin.

It will let you reconfigure the Discourse user interface to better fit web3 use cases and reduce barriers.

**OLD: Plugin Summary**

This plugin will implement ["SIGN-IN WITH ETHEREUM"](https://login.xyz/) for Discourse. Right now Discourse is very much tied to email. It is mandatory for users to provide an email address on signup.
After installing this plugin users will be able to sign in using ethereum. Emails will be optional. 
As a result people can use Discourse to experiment with ethereum based web3 applications.
