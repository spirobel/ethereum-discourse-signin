# **Ethereum Discourse Sign-in** Plugin

**Plugin Summary**

This plugin will implement ["SIGN-IN WITH ETHEREUM"](https://login.xyz/) for Discourse. Right now Discourse is very much tied to email. It is mandatory for users to provide an email address on signup.
After installing this plugin users will be able to sign in using ethereum. Emails will be optional. 
As a result people can use Discourse to experiment with ethereum based web3 applications.
